# Si70xx Espressif Example
This example is based on `esp32 mcu`.

## Requirements
- Up-to-date version of the [ESP IDF SDK](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html).
- Rust support for these devices is still a work in progress, and progress is being made rapidly, I suggest to
follow [The Rust on ESP Book](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/introduction.html) to install all requiremets.

## Build
